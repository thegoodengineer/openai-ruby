    # Files are used to upload documents that can be used with features like
    # Assistants and Fine-tuning.
    class Files
      # Upload a file that can be used across various endpoints. Individual files can be
      # up to 512 MB, and each project can store up to 2.5 TB of files in total. There
      # is no organization-wide storage limit. Uploads to this endpoint are rate-limited
      # to 1,000 requests per minute per authenticated user.
      #
      # - The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific file
      #   types. See the
      #   [Assistants Tools guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools)
      #   for details.
      # - The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has certain
      #   required formats for fine-tuning
      #   [chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input)
      #   or
      #   [completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input)
      #   models.
      # - The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input
      #   also has a specific required
      #   [format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).
      # - For Retrieval or `file_search` ingestion, upload files here first. If you need
      #   to attach multiple uploaded files to the same vector store, use
      #   [`/vector_stores/{vector_store_id}/file_batches`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/vector-stores-file-batches/createBatch)
      #   instead of attaching them one by one. Vector store attachment has separate
      #   limits from file upload, including 2,000 attached files per minute per
      #   organization.
      #
      # Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these
      # storage limits.
